<p align="top,right">A café setting is known as a casual social environment where you can find people reading newspapers and magazines, studying, or chatting with others about current events. It is known also regarded as a place where information can be exchanged.
A café is sometimes called a coffeehouse or a coffee shop or tea shop in English, a café in French and a bar in Italian. (Cafe or café is the common spelling used in English, French, Spanish, et al however the word is spelled "caffe" in Italian.) It shares some characteristics of a bar and some characteristics of a restaurant given its selection of foods and beverages served, but is distinct from a cafeteria which is a type of restaurant where customers can choose from many dishes displayed on a serving line. In some countries, cafés are designed to more closely resemble restaurants whereby offering a range of hot meals and possibly licensed to serve alcohol. Most British cafés however, do not sell alcohol likely due to the prominent pub culture</p>

<p align="left">A new type of café, known as the Internet café, was introduced in the 1990s and went hand in hand with the rising prevalence of computers in society. Computers and Internet access in a contemporary atmosphere created a youthful, modern public space compared to existing locales including traditional bars and old-fashioned diners. Nowadays, many cafés offer public wireless Internet or even have computers, telephones, and newspapers for customer use. Further integrating internet usage to the café atmosphere, some stores like Starbucks allow you to order directly from your smartphone, tablet, or other devices through their free store app or websites online.</p>
